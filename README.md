# Syndicate Share #

## What is a Syndicate Vessel? ##

A sydnicate vessel is a boat, car or aircraft owned by multiple individuals.
Each participant in the syndicate is the legal owner of a proportion of the vessel. The proportion they own dictates their share of costs, and the ammount of time/points they can book private use of the vessel each period.

This website will assist groups in managing each owners time allocation, as well as maintenance and accounting for vessel upkeep.
